# Iris_Analysis

This is a machine learning project that aims to classify Iris flowers into three different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project uses the popular Iris dataset, which contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the `iris.csv` file. It consists of the following columns:
- Sepal Length (in centimeters)
- Sepal Width (in centimeters)
- Petal Length (in centimeters)
- Petal Width (in centimeters)
- Species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica)

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/)
- Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Key Points:
- This involves Unsupervised learning.
- K-means clustering and principal component analysis algorithm are used to predict the accuracy.
- Visualized the data using 2D scatter plot.
